### Activities between meetings

- read\watch learn
- infinite online\offline communication;
- sub-group communication on

### Activities during  offline-meetings

- peer review;
- each sub group prepares mini-task from **placeholder_algorithm_book** and present the story of solution;
- task discussion;

## Peer review procedure


1. the one, who participate make fork of this repo
1. the one, who participate create a folder in `/tasks/%username%` location
    1. to track activity i'd(@Quodnon) urge to open **PR** prior to actually creating the solution.
    1. If someone is stuck with his task, there is always a helping hand of fellow kottan;
    1. that also means we shouldn't **watch** the repo, as there will be tons of notifications;
1. each task is done in own fork and then a pull-request made to kottans repo
1. Pull request is sent for review to fellow kottan - each new **PR** to **next** kottan;
1. ???? - means review here
1. Pull request accepted and those from group who have write access merge PR to master;
